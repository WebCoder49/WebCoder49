# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ from WebCoder49



I enjoy **coding websites** with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP! I also like creating videogames like [**Earth Explorer**](https://earthexplorer.og49.repl.co/), a platformer I created with some friends as graphics developers. I know **quite a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript** and **some PHP, Python and Java**, so if you want help with any of these, questions are welcome! **Please note that I may not be able to respond immediately.**

**Fun Fact:** *I also like the idea of Turing machines and have created a simulator [**here!**](https://turingtape.og49.repl.co/)*
